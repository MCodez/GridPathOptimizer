# GridPathOptimizer: Efficient Pathfinding with A* and Common Path Selection  

## Overview  
**GridPathOptimizer** is an intelligent **pathfinding algorithm** that efficiently finds **shortest paths** in a 2D coordinate space while maximizing **common path utilization**. A **power-aware** and **obstacle-aware** pathfinding algorithm designed for **VLSI routing**, specifically for **data and clock signal routing**. The algorithm minimizes **power domain crossings**, optimizes **shortest paths**, and intelligently utilizes **divergent paths** to ensure efficient signal propagation.

## Features  
‚úÖ **Grid-Based Movement**: Horizontal & vertical traversal with a configurable grid step size.  
‚úÖ **Optimized Path Selection**: Prioritizes common paths to minimize redundancy.  
‚úÖ **A(*) Algorithm for Pathfinding**: Uses an optimized **A-star (A*) search** for shortest path computation.  
‚úÖ **Divergence Point Calculation**: Identifies the best point of deviation for new paths.  
‚úÖ **Shortest Path Fallback**: If the divergence-based path is significantly longer, it switches to a direct shortest path.  
‚úÖ **Obstacle Handling**: Supports polygonal obstacles to avoid restricted areas.  
‚úÖ **VLSI-Aware Routing** ‚Äì Optimized for **clock tree synthesis (CTS)** and **data signal routing** in **chip design**.  
‚úÖ **Power Domain Awareness** ‚Äì Ensures paths remain within the same power domain as much as possible, minimizing crossings.  
‚úÖ **Configurable Parameters**: User-controlled grid size, divergence threshold, and step size.  
‚úÖ **Visualization with Matplotlib**: Generates color-coded plots highlighting paths.  

## üöÄ Applications in VLSI & Physical Design

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clock & Data Signal Routing**
- In **VLSI physical design**, **clock distribution networks** need optimized routing to reduce skew and power consumption.
- This algorithm can **optimize clock tree synthesis (CTS)** by **reusing existing paths** instead of computing independent shortest paths for each signal.  
- It can also **improve bus routing** in **SoC interconnect designs**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Multi-Net Optimization in PCB & Chip Layouts**
- **PCB trace routing** and **IC interconnect optimization** can use this algorithm to **reduce metal layer usage**.
- Can be used for **multi-net signal routing** in **MCM (Multi-Chip Modules)** and **3D-IC** designs.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Routing in Advanced VLSI Nodes**
- In **sub-10nm process nodes**, reducing **wire congestion** is crucial for **timing closure**.
- Our approach **minimizes wirelength** and **reuses common paths**, helping in **power, performance, and area (PPA) optimization**.

## Algorithm Workflow  
1. **First Path Calculation**  
   - Computes the shortest path using **A* (A-star) search algorithm** while avoiding obstacles.  
2. **New Path Addition**  
   - Finds the closest previously computed path to the new endpoint.  
   - Identifies the **best divergence point** by minimizing distance to the new endpoint.  
   - Constructs the new path using the common segment and diverging only when necessary.  
   - If the newly computed shortest path is significantly shorter than the divergence-based path, it is selected instead.  
3. **Visualization**  
   - Plots all paths in a uniform color with **directional arrows**.  
   - Highlights start and end points distinctly.  

## üéØ How Power Aware Routing Algorithm Works  
1Ô∏è‚É£ The grid is divided into **different power domains** (Pink, Green, Blue).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ User-defined **obstacles** are placed in the grid to simulate real-world constraints.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ The algorithm finds the **shortest path** while **minimizing power domain crossings**.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ If a direct path is **blocked**, it uses **divergent routing** from existing paths.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Each grid step has a **base cost**, and **power domain crossings** have a **high penalty (1000 units)**.  
6Ô∏è‚É£ The final path is **selected based on total cost** (shortest and least domain crossings).
