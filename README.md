# GridPathOptimizer: Efficient Pathfinding with A* and Common Path Selection  

## Overview  
**GridPathOptimizer** is an intelligent **pathfinding algorithm** that efficiently finds **shortest paths** in a 2D coordinate space while maximizing **common path utilization**. Unlike traditional **A* algorithms**, this approach ensures that new paths reuse existing paths as much as possible, reducing unnecessary deviations and optimizing routing efficiency.  

## Features  
‚úÖ **Grid-Based Movement**: Horizontal & vertical traversal with a configurable grid step size.  
‚úÖ **Optimized Path Selection**: Prioritizes common paths to minimize redundancy.  
‚úÖ **A(*) Algorithm for Pathfinding**: Uses an optimized **A-star (A*) search** for shortest path computation.  
‚úÖ **Divergence Point Calculation**: Identifies the best point of deviation for new paths.  
‚úÖ **Shortest Path Fallback**: If the divergence-based path is significantly longer, it switches to a direct shortest path.  
‚úÖ **Obstacle Handling**: Supports polygonal obstacles to avoid restricted areas.  
‚úÖ **VLSI-Aware Routing** ‚Äì Optimized for **clock tree synthesis (CTS)** and **data signal routing** in **chip design**.  
‚úÖ **Configurable Parameters**: User-controlled grid size, divergence threshold, and step size.  
‚úÖ **Visualization with Matplotlib**: Generates color-coded plots highlighting paths.

## üöÄ Applications in VLSI & Physical Design

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clock & Data Signal Routing**
- In **VLSI physical design**, **clock distribution networks** need optimized routing to reduce skew and power consumption.
- This algorithm can **optimize clock tree synthesis (CTS)** by **reusing existing paths** instead of computing independent shortest paths for each signal.  
- It can also **improve bus routing** in **SoC interconnect designs**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Multi-Net Optimization in PCB & Chip Layouts**
- **PCB trace routing** and **IC interconnect optimization** can use this algorithm to **reduce metal layer usage**.
- Can be used for **multi-net signal routing** in **MCM (Multi-Chip Modules)** and **3D-IC** designs.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Routing in Advanced VLSI Nodes**
- In **sub-10nm process nodes**, reducing **wire congestion** is crucial for **timing closure**.
- Our approach **minimizes wirelength** and **reuses common paths**, helping in **power, performance, and area (PPA) optimization**.

## Algorithm Workflow  
1. **First Path Calculation**  
   - Computes the shortest path using **A* (A-star) search algorithm** while avoiding obstacles.  
2. **New Path Addition**  
   - Finds the closest previously computed path to the new endpoint.  
   - Identifies the **best divergence point** by minimizing distance to the new endpoint.  
   - Constructs the new path using the common segment and diverging only when necessary.  
   - If the newly computed shortest path is significantly shorter than the divergence-based path, it is selected instead.  
3. **Visualization**  
   - Plots all paths in a uniform color with **directional arrows**.  
   - Highlights start and end points distinctly.
